			Oh No Baby Nails Website report, December 2020</br></br>
			I started to work on this project for a company called Oh No Baby Nails. The purpose of this page was to have 
			information in one platform and to have a page to find on google. This firmsâ€™ main page was still going to
			remain Instagram, but the owner wanted to have an official website as well where the customer could find 
			all the information, links, and all the Instagram pictures. </br></br>
			I started to think about the layout and designed some examples in Figma, and one of them was chosen by the owner.
			I started to build the page by using HTML and CSS based on what the design draft was. Together with the owner,
			we created an Instagram widget that I then embedded into the website and got the Timma embedding from the owner.
			The layout was clear from the start, but the process was still iterative with the owner and me. I asked for the 
			introduction text and the booking terms, but also asked opinions from the owner about colours, some elements on
			the page and due to the iteration, I succeeded to create a good layout in which the customer was satisfied. After
			the main elements found their place, I started thinking about Google SEO and modified the page in a way that it would be found in Google 
			search. I added keywords, descriptions, etc. Also, I created a favicon for the page. </br></br>
			After that, we realized the accessibility and realized the need to modify colour of the text. I also fixed 
			a few scalability related issues with the images and font-size, and now we are here.
