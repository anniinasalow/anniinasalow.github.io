	<h2 style="font-size:2vw;">About Me</h2>
		
		<p style="font-size:1.5vw;">My name is Anniina Salow and I graduated from University of Oulu on May, 2024, with a master’s degree in Information Processing Science.
        I am a problem solver to my nature and interested in the continuously developing world.        
	    My interests in the field are HCI, software testing, mobile networks, front-end development and big data, and I am looking forward to working with these subjects in future. 
		My programming knowledge is mostly with Python, HTML and CSS but I also know the basics with C and Java.
		</p>

        <p style="font-size:1.5vw;">With nearly three years of experience in manual and automated software testing at Nokia, I have developed a critical mind and learned 
        how to test software performance at its limits. Despite my previous trainee title, I have taken on the responsibilities of a full-time test engineer and had been involved 
        with extremely high-priority cases. I have learned to ensure software quality and to notice the smallest issues in software performance. I have been awarded several 
        times for my contributions and successes in my testing tasks and I am humbled by the positive feedback I have received from my colleagues. I have always said yes to new,
        more challenging opportunities and delivered high-quality results.  
        Even though I had the opportunity to work as a software tester, I also had the chance to get to explore data mining and artificial intelligence through my thesis, 
        supervised by a leading expert in the field. I created a sophisticated program which goes through a massive database, restructuring data into a format compatible 
        with a data visualization tool. The program is part of an automation and AI system and runs daily to provide up-to-date data for management. The program isn’t just 
        reading from a file; it mines the database and creates a whole new index to be able to use for specific management reports now and in the future. 
		</p>
		<br />             
		<p style="font-size:1.5vw;">As an employee, I am hardworking and I highly appreciate both working in a team and a good working environment.
        I am at my best when I work under pressure hence I seek challenges in my career.
        I want to always do my job well and developing my skills in this industry is something I am eager to continue. 
        These features show in my work and in the feedback I have gotten. 
		 I have always known that my future is with ICT and that dream still stands.
