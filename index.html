	<h2 style="font-size:2vw;">About Me</h2>
		
		<p style="font-size:1.5vw;">My name is Anniina Salow and I am studying Information Processing Science at University of Oulu. I am fascinated about everything you can do with a computer.
		When comes to my studies, my interests are mostly with HCI, digitalisation, mobile networks, internet in general, and websites. 
		I am looking forward to working with these subjects in future. I'm very interested in HCI and I supported my knowledge in that area with studying psychology.
		I can do simple programs mostly with Python, HTML and CSS but I also know the basics with C, and Java.
		I have created two websites with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and used Figma as a prototyping tool and also created a data retrieval program with Python to retrieve specific data from big data.	 
		</p>
		<br />
		
		<p style="font-size:1.5vw;">As an employee, I am hardworking, a teamplayer and motivated. I am also ambitious and want to pursue my dreams in my upcoming career.
         I am at my best when I work under pressure hence I seek for challenges in my career.
		 I am a problem solver and have great organizational skills, and feel these features show well in my work. I really want to learn more about the industry
		and I can't wait to get a more experience in the field. I have always known that my future is with ICT and technology. Everyday I am getting closer to my future goals and that is important to me.
